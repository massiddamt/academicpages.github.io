Hi, I am Matteo. 
I am currently a Post-Doc Researcher at the University of Sassari.

After few years of wet-lab I was fascinated by Bioinformatics and started working in this field during my PhD.

From September 2018 to October 2022 I worked at CRS4. My principal responsability was the development of high processivity and reproducible pipelines for NGS data analysis.
These pipelines are freely available on github at [solida-core](https://github.com/solida-core).<br>

In November 2022 I started working at the University of Sassari as Post-Doc Researcher.

Personal Interests
======
During my free time I like playing with my kids or go out for a beer with my friends.

Recently I started playing padel and I noticed I am a little addicted....

Apart that I also like music and playing my guitar.

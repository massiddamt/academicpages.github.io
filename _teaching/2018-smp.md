Molecular Structure of Proteins - SSD: BIO/11
======
The course was held as part of the Master Degree in Cellular and Molecular Biology 


EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES
======
The aim of this course consists of providing an advanced knowledge of protein molecular structures and functions. A peculiar attention is dedicated to the synthesis, modification and destruction of the polypeptide chain, so to better understand how cellsâ€™ functionality is finely managed. Methods and techniques for the analysis of the different levels of protein structure will be covered in both lectures and laboratory experiences.

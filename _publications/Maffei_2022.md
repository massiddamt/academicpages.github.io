## Abstract
Lipodystrophy (LD) indicates a group of rare disorders, with generalized or partial loss of white adipose tissue (WAT) often associated with metabolic derangements. Heterogeneity/wide spectrum of the disease and lack of biomarkers make diagnosis often difficult. MicroRNAs are important to maintain a correct WAT function and WAT is a source of circulating miRNAs (cmiRs). miRNAs from 320 family were previously detected in the WAT and variably associated to the metabolic syndrome. Our aim was then to investigate if LD can result in altered abundance of cmiRs-320. We collected samples from a cohort of LD subjects of various subtypes and from age matched controls. Use of quantitative PCR determined that cmiRs- 320a-3p, 320b, 320c, 320e are upregulated, while 320d is downregulated in LD. CmiRs-320 power as classifiers was more powerful in the most extreme and defined forms of LD, including the generalized and the Dunnigan subtypes. cmiR-320a-3p showed significant inverse relationships with plasma leptin (P < 0.0001), typically low in LD. The hepatic enzymes gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and the marker of inflammation C-reactive protein (CRP) were inversely related to cmiR 320d (P < 0.05, for CRP and GGT; P < 0.01, for AST and ALT). Gene ontology analysis revealed cell-cell adhesion as a process regulated by 320 miRNAs targets, thus disclosing a novel route to investigate origin of WAT loss/dysfunction. In conclusion, cmiRs-320 constitute novel biomarkers of LD, abundance of miR320a-3p is inversely associated to indicators related to WAT function, while downregulation of cmiR-320d predicts an altered hepatic profile and higher inflammation.
